      A few minutes after 7am, Friday 21<sup>st</sup> October 2016.

      We are excited to cross the Channel to reach out our native country. Although we _do not know what to expect_ when we arrive in the camps.

      We are the **last car to make it to the ferry**: they closed the boarding ramp right after we turned the engine off.

      We befriend with Jamie as he is sharing the ride as well.

      He is taking a few weeks off to volunteer at Dunkirk's refugees camp. He went there earlier this year but was not prepared for the harsh winter conditions.

      This time he _feels ready_.

      We randomly discover that our ferry is actually heading to Dunkirk, not Calais.

      Because we met Jamie, we decide to give him a hand and to go with him to Dunkirk refugees camp. We will go to Calais tomorrow, with some more experience, knowledge and hopefully confidence.

I felt it became necessary to go beyond the _mass media_ depiction of the Calais refugees camp. So my friend [Basile](https://basilesimon.fr) and I packed our bags and booked a carpooling.
