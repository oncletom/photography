      I notice three things as I arrive in Tallinn:
      - chimney towers;
      - snow is prevalent;
      - the light is sublime.

      People are proud of their country. They fought hard to remove signs and symbols of the communist occupancy.

      Even the snow is proud of Estonia.

      A cemetery in a forest.

      First day out of town.
      I had to read an information panel to learn I am walking
      on sand dunes. The cold temperature make them hard
      as stone.

      The day I observed swans bathing in ponds formed by frozen sea water.

      I still have 5 kilometres to go to catch a bus before dusk takes over.

      I missed the bus because I misread the timetable. I have to wait 40 minutes more before the next one.


      These blokes drank beer this entire time, thirsty as if they were
      coming back from a desert of some sort.


      The bus driver will drop me in the forest by night.
      I forgot my gloves on the bus and still have to pitch
      my tent in the dark.

      It is so cold it took me 30 minutes to fold my tent.

      People don't camp by these temperatures, nor their hike on long distances either.

      Everything is white and cold. My brain stops thinking at some point.

      Or it keeps banging around the same ideas over and over.

      It is nearly noon and I have already walked 19 kilometres in the snow.

      The city looks empty, and I can only hear echoes of cars gliding on the tarmac.

      Temperatures are gowing to dive below -8Â°C tonight so I decide to stop the outdoor adventure and go to Tartu instead.

      The next train is in 30 minutes, then in _4 hours_. Sadly for me, I was waiting on the wrong platform: 30 seconds to board is not enough! I will have to go back to Tallinn to then be able to go to Tartu.

      PS: I love the logo of their [railway company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eesti_Raudtee)!

      I love the wooden architecture of Estonian houses.
      Or maybe it is about the combination of decay and soft colours.

      Three kilometres to go before arriving to my shelter: a small house
      by the lake with a fireplace. I will treat myself with noodles.

      The only source of sound are the crows, nesting nearby.

      Well, almost: the thick layer of ice covering the 270km<sup>2</sup> lake profoundly squeaks as it plows under its own weight.

      Like a whale in deep sea.

      This moment made me think of the [Clifton suspension bridge](http://www.cliftonbridge.org.uk/) in Bristol.

      I wish you were there.

      Walls are a democratic way of expression if you think about it.

      The last ray of lights of my last day in Estonia.

      And Benoit just sent me an email.

A friend of mine recommended me Estonia for its hiking trails. I thought it would be nice to spend my 33<sup>rd</sup> birthday in a tent pitched in the forest.
