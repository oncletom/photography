      I stayed there for a while, observing how people choose their products.

      I could see many similarities with how people buy their food on French
      and British open markets.

      I loved walking outdoors, roaming in the old city, quirky streets and
      palaces to then uncover some gems of greenery.

      Ultimately, the green corridor led to this upside view of Prague.

      At last, something different from the usual postcard views.
