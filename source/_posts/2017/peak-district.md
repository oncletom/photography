    I have had the pleasure to experience again the buccolic english countryside, as I used to do when my parents brought us around during summer holidays.

    Second day out. It was funny to discover other people on the trail so early in the morning, as they also camped overnight in the area, in great silence.

    Third day out. I feel I'd be happy to go back home now. Tired and replenished.

  I was both craving to pitch my tent and to discover more England greenery.
  So I booked a one-way ticket to Edale to then decide where would I go next: North? South? Dark Peak, here I come!
