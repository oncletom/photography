      My first encounter with the venitian lights. They are so warm in winterâ€¦


      I remember this sentiment of peace as we walk, randomly, in the nearly
      empty streets.

      Everything looks _so_ beautiful right now. We bump onto a cohort of  tourists only at the end of our first afternoon â€” they have not disappeared after all.

      The sunset strokes our eyes with a long and powerful pyrotechnic show. Although there is still a long wait to go before getting to see the new year's eve fireworks.

      A _good_ and _slow_ start for the new year.

      I feel blessed again by the _warmth of sunrises and sunsets_. It gives an even deeper intensity to the turquoise colour of the canals.

      A game of lights and mirrors.

      We move to this neigbourhood tomorrow and I already love it.

      No wonder why italian painters have been so good at capturing the _colourful details_ of _light_.

      Finally _one odd thing_ in such a quaint city.

      You would not fit more than a couple people in this tiny coffee place.

      One might want to hop onto nearby islands to discover different ambiances, and different landscapes.

      On our list: Murano, Burano, Torcello and San Lazzaro.

      The journey to Burano is the most beautiful one with its ample empty spaces. I would almost forget we are only a few kilometers from the mainland, on a thin layer of water.

      My preference goes to Burano over Murano. For the colours. For being less busy.

      Torcello is sitting on the horizon, seven minutes away by waterbus.

      I loved the wilderness of the island and the disproportionate magnificence of its basilica and church. Rustic but well executed.

      A maze which forks to a dead end: a pontoon over the water, blessed with a warm sunshine.

      Utilitarian for the locals.
      An romantic escape from the moving crowd for others.

First trip in Italy. First holidays together. And a second New Year's Eve spent by the water â€” this time not quite as quiet.
