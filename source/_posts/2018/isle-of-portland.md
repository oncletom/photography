  A curiosity spotted on Google Maps.
  I did not know we would discover an open air quarry and a huge shingle formation.

    Outside a quirky footpath, we uncover a breathtaking view of Chesil Beach.

    One of the largest shingle beach in the UK. A good thirty kilometres long!

    The tip of the island. And a ~~curiosity~~ tourism magnet,
    as are most of British lighthouses.
